## 1. Description
This project is a new practical item of my mobile app series that made with native RN components and:
 - react native v0.65.1
 - [stack-navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/) - (to make transitions between screens)
 - [react-native-snap-carousel](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel) - (to make scrollable screens and components)
 - [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) - (UI Toolkit for RN apps)
 - [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - (UI buttons and logos)
 - [react-native-prompt-android](https://github.com/shimohq/react-native-prompt-android#readme) - (To show prompt in Android and iOS platform)
 - Of course, I used things like custom hooks, components, navigator and context API to manage theme app.
